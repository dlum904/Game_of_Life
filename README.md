Implement Conway's Game of Life (description in Wikipedia).

- Made using JavaScript.
- Added a pause and resume button that pauses and resumes the game.
- Used localstorage to save and store the game state.
- Was trying to add an increase/decrease speed feature, but ran into issues.


Requirements:


1. Support a large universe 2^64 x 2^64. The universe is mostly empty, except for the area with the object(s) (for example, four gliders moving away from the center in opposite directions).


2. There should be a simple UI with the possibility to configure the initial state of the universe (100 x 100), start the algorithm, and observe the changes. There should also be a function to store/load the state to/from a persistent storage.


3. It's a "homework assignment" with 48 hours to complete. Publish your results on GitHub or GitLab (or elsewhere). Once your solution is up, please let us know so we can review and get back to you with follow up questions.
