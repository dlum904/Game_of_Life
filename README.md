Implement Conway's Game of Life

- Made using JavaScript.
- Added a pause and resume button that pauses and resumes the game.
- Used localstorage to save and store the game state.
- Was trying to add an increase/decrease speed feature, but ran into issues.
- Click to add/remove live cells.
- TODO use different data structure to be able to have a larger grid size.
